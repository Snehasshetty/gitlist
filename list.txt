VIVA QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### 🔹 **1️⃣ What is DevOps?**

DevOps is a culture and set of practices that integrate **Development** and **Operations** teams to deliver software **faster, reliably, and continuously** through automation.

---

### 🔹 **2️⃣ What are the main stages of DevOps lifecycle?**

* **Plan** (JIRA, Azure Boards)
* **Code** (Git, GitHub)
* **Build** (Maven, npm)
* **Test** (JUnit, Selenium)
* **Deploy** (Jenkins, Ansible, Docker)
* **Operate** (Kubernetes)
* **Monitor** (Prometheus, Grafana)

---

### 🔹 **3️⃣ What is CI/CD?**

* **Continuous Integration:** Code is frequently integrated, built, and tested automatically.
* **Continuous Delivery/Deployment:** Code is automatically deployed to staging/production with minimal manual steps.

---

### 🔹 **4️⃣ What is Jenkins used for?**

Jenkins is an **automation server** used to create **CI/CD pipelines**, performing tasks like:
✔ Pull code
✔ Build
✔ Test
✔ Deploy
Automatically on every code change.

---

### 🔹 **5️⃣ What are Build tools you used?**

* **Java apps → Maven**
* **Node.js apps → npm or Makefile**
* **PHP → No build, only copy deployment**

---

### 🔹 **6️⃣ Commands for Jenkins workspace execution**

Example Node:

```bash
npm install
npm test || true
npm start &
```

Example Docker deploy:

```bash
docker build -t app:v1 .
docker run --name app -d -p 3000:3000 app:v1
```

---

### 🔹 **7️⃣ What is Docker? Why is it used?**

Docker is a **containerization platform** used to package applications with their dependencies so they run **consistently across environments**.

Benefits:
✔ Portable
✔ Lightweight
✔ Faster deployment
✔ Scales easily

---

### 🔹 **8️⃣ What is the difference between VM and Containers?**

| Virtual Machine | Container      |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| Heavyweight     | Lightweight    |
| Boots OS        | Shares Host OS |
| Slow startup    | Fast startup   |
| GB size         | MB size        |

---

### 🔹 **9️⃣ Dockerfile — what is it?**

A text file containing **instructions** to build a Docker image.

Example:

```dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["npm","start"]
```

---

### 🔹 **10️⃣ Docker commands you used**

```bash
docker build -t app:v1 .
docker images
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 app:v1
docker ps -a
docker rm -f app
docker login && docker push app:v1
```

---

### 🔹 **11️⃣ What is Kubernetes?**

Kubernetes is a **container orchestration** platform that automates:
✔ Deployment
✔ Scaling
✔ Load Balancing
✔ Self-healing of containers

---

### 🔹 **12️⃣ What is a Pod / Deployment / Service?**

| Concept        | Purpose                                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Pod**        | Smallest unit → runs container(s)      |
| **Deployment** | Manages ReplicaSets, updates, scaling  |
| **Service**    | Provides stable network access to Pods |

---

### 🔹 **13️⃣ Check Kubernetes connection**

```bash
kubectl get nodes
cat ~/.kube/config
```

---

### 🔹 **14️⃣ How to apply manifests?**

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
kubectl get pods
kubectl get svc
```

---

### 🔹 **15️⃣ What is Git used for?**

Git is a **distributed version control** system used for tracking changes in source code.

Basic commands:

```bash
git clone <url>
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin master
```

---

### 🔹 **16️⃣ What is Maven?**

Build automation tool for **Java** that handles:
✔ Compile
✔ Test
✔ Package (war/jar)
Using **pom.xml**

```bash
mvn package
```

---

### 🔹 **17️⃣ What is Tomcat used for?**

Tomcat is a **Java application server** for deploying **WAR (Web Application Archive)** files.

Service commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl start tomcat9
sudo systemctl status tomcat9
```

---

### 🔹 **18️⃣ Basic troubleshooting in CI**

| Error                     | Reason                       | Fix                              |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `sudo: password required` | Jenkins can't use sudo       | Remove sudo                      |
| `404 Manager not found`   | Tomcat manager not installed | `sudo apt install tomcat9-admin` |
| Docker push denied        | No DockerHub credentials     | Add credentials in Jenkins       |

---

### 🔹 **19️⃣ Why avoid sudo in Jenkins Execute Shell?**

Because Jenkins runs as **non-root user**, and **cannot provide password** → build fails.
Tools must be **pre-installed** on CI server.

---

### 🔹 **20️⃣ Advantages of CI/CD in real-world**

* Faster delivery
* Fewer errors
* Automated deployment
* Consistent builds
* Better collaboration
