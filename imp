## 🔹Web Services (SOAP, REST, SOA)

1️⃣ **What is a Web Service?**
A Web service is a loosely-coupled software component delivered over Internet standard technologies, exposing business logic as services.


2️⃣ **What is SOA?**
Service-Oriented Architecture allows distributed software components from different systems to be exposed as services.


3️⃣ **Give characteristics of Web Services**

* XML messaging
* Cross-platform integration
* Self-describing
* Accessible through firewalls


4️⃣ **What is WSDL?**
XML-based specification describing Web services operations, messages, and binding mechanisms.


5️⃣ **What is UDDI? Mention its components**
UDDI is an XML-based registry for publishing & discovering Web services.
Components: **White Pages, Yellow Pages, Green Pages**


6️⃣ **SOAP Message Structure**
SOAP Envelope → Header (optional) → Body (mandatory) → Fault (optional)


7️⃣ **SOAP Communication Styles**

* RPC
* Document / message-style


8️⃣ **What is a SOAP intermediary?**
Extra SOAP nodes processing headers along message path.


9️⃣ **Difference: SOAP vs REST**

| SOAP               | REST             |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| XML Protocol       | HTTP Standard    |
| Stateful/Stateless | Always Stateless |
| Heavy              | Lightweight      |
| WSDL               | URI Based        |

REST has **Representations, URIs, Stateless, Links, Caching**


10️⃣ **REST HTTP Methods**
GET, POST, PUT, DELETE


---

## 🔹Java Web Service (Experiment Questions)

11️⃣ **What is the role of `@WebService` and `@WebMethod`?**

* `@WebService` → exposes class as SOAP service
* `@WebMethod` → publishes specific operations


12️⃣ **Why generate client stubs using wsimport?**
To create proxy classes enabling remote method invocation.


13️⃣ **How to view WSDL of your service?**
Open: `http://localhost:8085/calculator?wsdl`


---

## 🔹Cloud Computing Fundamentals

14️⃣ **Define cloud computing (NIST)**
On-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable resources with minimal management effort.


15️⃣ **Cloud Service Models**

* SaaS
* PaaS
* IaaS


16️⃣ **Deployment Models**

* Public cloud
* Private cloud
* Hybrid cloud


17️⃣ **Advantages of Private Cloud**
Exclusive environment, custom security, high performance


18️⃣ **Advantages of Public Cloud**
No CapEx, scalability, affordability


19️⃣ **Advantages of Hybrid Cloud**
Policy-driven, secure scaling, high reliability


20️⃣ **Cloud attributes**
On-demand self-service, elasticity, broad access, pooled resources, measured service


---

## 🔹Virtualization (important topic)

21️⃣ **Define virtualization in cloud computing**
Software creates virtual servers/resources that behave like hardware.


22️⃣ **Types of Virtualization**

* Server virtualization
* Data virtualization
* Hardware virtualization
* Storage virtualization


23️⃣ **Difference: Virtualization vs Cloud**
Virtualization → technology
Cloud → service environment using virtualization


---

## 🔹CAM Lab — OpenStack / Private Cloud (Basic Viva)

24️⃣ **What is OpenStack?**
Open-source cloud software suite to build private cloud infrastructure.


25️⃣ **VM (Virtual Machine) Definition**
A software computer with virtual devices providing same functionality as physical hardware.


---

## 🔹SLA (Service Level Agreement)

26️⃣ **What is SLA?**
Document outlining commitment between service provider and client.


27️⃣ **Types of SLA**

* Customer SLA
* Service-based SLA
* Multi-level SLA


28️⃣ **Service Performance Metrics** (examples)
Availability, response time, incident resolution time


29️⃣ **Key Components of SLA**
Agreement overview, stakeholders, services, service levels, exclusions, cancellation conditions, performance metrics


30️⃣ **Indemnification Clause**
Indemnitor takes responsibility for losses/damages from contract breach.

| XML use in Web services  | Message format                  |
| WSDL stores?             | Operations, endpoints, messages |
| Soap transport commonly? | HTTP                            |
| REST stateless?          | Yes                             |
| NFS / SMB                | Linux share / Windows share     |
| Hypervisor role          | Manages VMs                     |
| Pool in TrueNAS?         | Storage group                   |

(Experiment questions are all inside your PDF – Tomcat setup, wsimport, NFS mount etc.)

# 👌 If you want, I can give:

✔ 10-marks long answers
✔ Short notes (REST, SLA, virtualization, OpenStack)
✔ Diagram-based answers (SOAP structure, Cloud models)

Would you like me to also give:
📌 **One-page viva cheat sheet** for revision before exam?
📌 **Practical troubleshooting questions** (Tomcat errors, wsimport errors, NFS mount issues)?
